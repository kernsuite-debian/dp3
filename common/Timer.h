/// \brief Very accurate timer for elapsed times.

/// Put timer.start() and timer.stop() calls around the piece of
/// code to be timed; make sure that start() and stop() calls alternate.
/// A timer can be started and stopped multiple times; both the average and
/// total time, as well as the number of iterations are printed.
/// The measured time is real time (as opposed to user or system time).
/// The timer can be used to measure from 1 nanosecond to a century interval.
/// The accuracy of the timer depends on the platform.
///
/// The internal RAII class StartStop can be used to do the start/stop.
/// The constructor starts the timer, while the destructor stops it. It has
/// the advantage that no explicit stop has to be given.
/// Moreover, it makes the start/stop exception-safe.
///
/// @tparam Clock Clock type, which meets the
/// <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/Clock">Clock named
/// requirements</a>. This argument allows using a mocked clock.

/**
 * Helper class to accumulate the execution time of multiple timers.
 *
 * Objects of this class measure duration of their life-time and add that time
 * to @a accumulator. The class is intended to be used in scope based fashion,
 * thus it's neither copyable nor movable.
 *
 * It's intended the class can be used to accumulate one timer from multiple
 * threads, so it should be able to use a @ref std::atomic<T>. Unfortunately
 * @ref std::atomic<T> for floating-point types requires C++20.
 *
 * The resolution of the class is based on the Âµs resolution of the @ref NSTimer
 * class.
