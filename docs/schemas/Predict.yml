inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'predict' `.`
  sourcedb:
    type: string
    doc: Path of sourcedb in which a sky model is stored (the output of makesourcedb) `.` When the path ends with ``.skymodel`` or ``.txt`` DP3 expects a skymodel file as used by makesourcedb. This makes it possible to directly use a skymodel file without using makesourcedb to convert the file.
  sources:
    default: "[]"
    type: array
    doc: Patches to use in the predict step of the calibration `.`
  usebeammodel:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Use the LOFAR beam in the predict part of the calibration `.`
  operation:
    default: replace
    type: string
    doc: Should the predicted visibilities replace those being processed (``replace``, default), should they be subtracted from those being processed (``subtract``) or added to them (``add``) `.`
  applycal&#46;*:
    doc: Set of options for applycal to apply to this predict. For this applycal-substep, .invert is off by default, so the predicted visibilities will be corrupted with the parmdb `.`
  beamproximitylimit:
    type: float

  correcttimesmearing:
    type: int
    default: 1
    doc: >-
      Apply time smearing correction by upsampling the uvw values before
      predicting and averaging the predicted data afterwards.
      The value is the upsampling and averaging factor.
      A value of 0 or 1 disables time smearing.

    type: boolean
    doc: Simulate frequency smearing based on the channel width, by multiplying the visibility with a sinc function `.`
    default: false
