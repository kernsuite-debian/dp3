  "Allows to split the data stream and process each splitted stream with different settings."
inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'split' `.`
  steps:
    default: "[]"
    type: array of strings
    doc: List of next steps; each step will run after this step. E.g. ``[average, msout]`` `.`
  replaceparms:
    default: "[]"
    type: array of strings
    doc: >-
      A list of key names that are different for each of the next steps. The keys that are specified in this list should themselves be given as a list of parameters. E.g., for ``split.replaceparms = [average.timestep, msout.name]``, the average.timestep and msout.name should now be specified as arrays, e.g. ``average.timestep=[1, 4]``.
      The number of streams that the input is split into is determined from the keywords that are specified by split.replaceparms. For example, there will be two stream in the above example because average.timestep (as should all other specified keywords) lists two values `.`
